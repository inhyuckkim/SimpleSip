* **Text:**
    * Simply open the lid of your SimpleSip Portable Matcha Maker.
    * Add your desired amount of matcha powder. For a standard serving, we recommend 1-2 teaspoons (2-4 grams) of matcha powder.
    * Pour in hot or cold water – whatever your craving calls for! For best results, fill the cup up to the designated fill line (usually around 6-8 ounces or 180-240ml), leaving a little room for blending.
    * *No need for multiple bowls, whisks, or measuring cups – just your SimpleSip and ingredients.*
